random scripts that i written during language exchanging for fun, made by a native chinese person.

note that always try to find official pinyin annotations whenever possible,
this is only used as a fallback and might give poor quality/accuracy,
so the needs of some sort of manual correction are expected.

some code quality are shit ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
